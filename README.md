What is RapidGrid?
------------------

RapidGrid is a tool which aims to allow for quick creation of grid layout for HTML pages. It supports systems like [960 Grid System][1] and extends them somewhat. You can create multiple layout strips and columns, change their width and the sequence in which they appear in page markup.

RapidGrid is built using [jQuery][2] and [jQuery UI][3] as well as some elements of [Bootstrap from Twitter][4].
